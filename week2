SOLIDITY DEEP DIVE
constructors-
constructor() <Access Modifier> {          
} 
Itâ€™s an optional function which initializes state variables of the contract. A constructor can be either internal or public, an internal constructor marks contract as abstract. 
is called once the contract is created

   }

   function set(uint _num) public{//taking a value as argument for num
       //writing a variable
       num =_num;
       //override the existinfg value with new value
       //state of the variable gets updated on chain

Reading and writing a state variable
1)solidity is a statically ttyped language(matlab every variable will have an associated type with it during compilation time)
2)the concept of undefined or null doesnt exist in solidity

3)default value of boolean- false
address-0x0
4)int can of base sie from 8 to 256
5)address holds a 20 bye value-address are of two types payable and non payable
6)enums/struct -user defined data type
7)struct is similar to clases s
8)bytes data type -used to holds sequence of bytes and used to store string
9)address payable a-this makes the variable a payable
10)we can make a non-payable add toa payable one one by involving typecastingg
11)what is the default specifier for solidity?-Internal***********
12)signed intergers- can hold *negative* value


13)declaring a variable 
address public addr =0x243873019470937401c

14)fixed size byte array=byte1,byte2,byte3.....byte32---
so here byte1 -will hold a sequence of one byte
